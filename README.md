# Farming
Two engineers decide to become farmers

## Motivation

People eat, so farming is fundamental. Farmers don't compute, so farming is inefficient. That's why two engineers (John and I) decide to become farmers.

We see farming as a robotics and data science problem. It helps to define it as a function that consumes inputs (resources) to yield outputs (crops). Then, this project is to optimize such a function and the related physical processes.

The optimization aims to maximize the efficiency in resources usage as well as the output. We identify the problems and solutions for each resource.

Moreover, we wish to create a "farm in a box" - so it can be better studied, optimized, and used. This is aims to democratize farming.


## Resources - Problems and Solutions

### Land

**Problem:** Traditional farming is very 2 dimensional, and it takes up a lot of space. This poses a lot of limitations.

1. It limits how much you can farm. Land costs money, so that limits the area you can buy. Larger area is also hard to maintain as it is harder to cover it with tractors, piping, sprinklers etc.
2. It limits where you can farm. Typically it is where land is cheap, and that is far from urban areas. It is also not trivial to find a suitable terrain. The location also adds transportation costs and limits access to infrastructure.

**Solution:** Make farming 3 dimensional by using a deckered system and solve all the problems above. Each additional deck increases the efficiency of space usage by a factor, and enables farming closer to urban areas. Compactness also make the application of technology and infrastructure affordable. This is no news to hydroponic farming.


### Soil

**Problem:** Although soil is not a scarce resource, 2 dimensional farming utilizes only the top layer of the exposed soil, and the bottom layer is wasted. Suitable type of soil is needed for farming, and that limits where you can farm. After a farming cycle, the soil needs to be refertilized, and that is a very laborious task.

**Solution:** Extract the soil and spread it on a deckered system to the suitable depth, compactness, etc. We can also engineer the soil content as wanted. Soil is already seen as a commodity as they are already available for purchase. With the use of a deckered system, we can recycle un-fertilized soil or just switch it out very easily.


### Fertilizers, Pest and Weed Control

**Problem:** These are applied over a general area, therefore lacks accuracy and efficiency. It is laborious. There is little targetedness, and although there is portion and timing control done by human guess work or by experience, it is not closely monitored or optimized.

**Solution:** A compact deckered system makes it feasible for machine to perform these tasks and replace human labor. An automated monitoring system will monitor the effects of application, then learn and optimize it over time. The system will also do targeting to increase specificity and reduce waste.


### Water

**Problem:** Farming uses a lot of water. This faces a similar problem as above.

**Solution:** Same solution as above.


### Climate control

**Problem:** The same problem as what a greenhouse solves.

**Solution:** A smaller area means easiness to control the climate. This will be a deckered system inside a greenhouse, although it is optional by crop.


### Seeds

**Problem:** For small scale farming, seeds need to be ensured healthy. Typically this is done by human labor.

**Solution:** A machine can learn to pick and use only the healthy seeds.


### Farm in a box

If we can compactify and optimize farming as described above, we can pack it into a box, and make the system trivial to use. With the ease of distribution and usage, everyone can farm.

Note that the limits discussed above would also be radically reduced. Coupled with a robotics system, the farm in a box can scale to resemble a factory.
